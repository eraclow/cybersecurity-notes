## Cybersecurity Notes

A personal knowledge base documenting my journey in cybersecurity.

This repository contains structured notes, technical explanations, lab learnings and practical observations collected while studying different areas of security.

The purpose is to build long-term understanding rather than short-term memorization.

### Scope

Topics in this repository may include:

 - Web security

 - Authentication & session handling

 - Common vulnerability classes

 - Security concepts & architectures

 - Practical lab takeaways

 - Tool behavior and observations

Content grows over time as new subjects are studied.

### Philosophy

Instead of collecting payloads, the focus is on understanding systems:

 - how technologies work

 - what assumptions developers rely on

 - where those assumptions fail

 - why vulnerabilities appear

 - how mitigations actually protect

The goal is to understand security, not just reproduce attacks.

### Structure

Notes are grouped by topic and learning source.
Each section aims to explain concepts in a clear and reusable way.

This repository acts as a continuously evolving reference for future practice and review.

### Status

Work in progress — updated as learning continues.
